	DMS_BasesToImportOnServerStart = 	[
// List of static bases to import on server startup (spawned post-init). This will reduce the amount of work the server has to do when it actually spawns static missions, and players won't be surprised when a base suddenly pops up. You can also include any other M3E-exported bases to spawn here.

//"saltflatsbase",		//<--Example (already imported by default on Altis)
